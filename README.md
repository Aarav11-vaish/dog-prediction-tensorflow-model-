Welcome to Dog Vision with TensorFlow! This project focuses on classifying dog breeds using TensorFlow, a powerful deep learning library. By training a model on a dataset of dog images, we aim to accurately predict the breed of unseen dog images.

## Overview

Dog Vision with TensorFlow is a machine learning project dedicated to building a robust model capable of identifying dog breeds from input images. Leveraging TensorFlow's capabilities, we delve into the realm of deep learning to create an efficient and accurate solution.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation comprises a comprehensive collection of dog images, each meticulously labeled with its corresponding breed. To ensure robust model training and testing, the dataset is meticulously divided into training and validation sets.

## Model Architecture

Our model architecture is based on the MobileNetV2 architecture, renowned for its efficiency and effectiveness in image classification tasks. MobileNetV2 has been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, and we employ transfer learning techniques to fine-tune it for the specific task of dog breed classification.

## Training and Evaluation

The model undergoes rigorous training using the training dataset, with performance evaluation conducted on the validation dataset. Throughout the training process, key metrics such as loss and accuracy are closely monitored to gauge the model's effectiveness.

## Results

Our trained model achieves impressive accuracy in predicting dog breeds on unseen images. The project documentation provides detailed insights into the results, including prediction examples and comprehensive performance metrics.
